/// It exists because the worktree's `.git` entry points into a developer's ordinary working clone,
/// which holds whatever it last happened to fetch. Review Bot refreshes only the base branch and,
/// for a same-repository pull request, the head branch before a review — every other ref in that
/// clone (local and remote-tracking branches, reflogs, `FETCH_HEAD`, `packed-refs`) can be
/// arbitrarily stale, and a reviewer that can read git's files or run `git` will find them. On a
/// release pull request (head `develop`, base `main`) two reviewers read an `origin/develop` one
/// commit behind the pull request's head, concluded the pull request was a side branch into `main`,
/// and posted a false `BLOCKING`. Stating the facts here means no reviewer has to infer them.
